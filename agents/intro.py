# AI agents are the brains of the game. They are responsible for making decisions for the player.

# three main components of an agent:
# 1. Perception: The agent must be able to perceive the game state. This is done by reading the game state from the game engine.

# 2. Decision Making: The agent must be able to make decisions based on the game state. This is done by analyzing the game state and deciding on the best course of action.

# 3. Action: The agent must be able to take actions based on its decisions. This is done by sending commands to the game engine.

# types of agents:

# 1. Simple reflex agents: These agents make decisions based on the current game state. They do not take into account the history of the game or the future consequences of their actions.

# 2. Model-based reflex agents: These agents maintain a model of the game state and use it to make decisions. They take into account the history of the game and the future consequences of their actions.

# 3. Goal-based agents: These agents have a goal or objective that they are trying to achieve. They make decisions based on how well their actions are helping them achieve their goal.

# 4. Utility-based agents: These agents assign a utility value to each possible action and choose the action with the highest utility value.

# 5. Learning agents: These agents learn from their past experiences and use that knowledge to make decisions.
