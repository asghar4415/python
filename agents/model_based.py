# this is a program for a Model-Based Reflex Agent

# the scenario is of a coffee shop. The agent is supposed to serve coffee to customers when they ask for it. The agent has a simple rule: if a customer asks for coffee, serve coffee. If the coffee shop runs out of coffee, the agent should order more coffee.
